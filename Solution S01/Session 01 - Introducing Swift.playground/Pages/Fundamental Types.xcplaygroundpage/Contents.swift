### Exercise 1

**Task:** Create an `Int` constant with the value `42`
*/

let x = 42

/*:
**Task:** Create a `String` constant using the above `Int` constant which states

*21 is only half the truth*
*/
let y: String = "\(x/2) is only half the truth"



//: **Task:** Print your string inline
y


/*:
In Swift we use constants whenever possible

*Hint: Always use constants (`let`) except you need a variable (the compiler will complain, if you really need one)*
